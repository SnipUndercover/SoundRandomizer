SnipUndercover_SoundRandomizer_Warning=
    WARNING: This mod messes with the FMOD audio system used by Celeste.
    Playing an FMOD audio event returns an EventInstance, and not all EventInstance references
    are kept around. Losing an EventInstance reference loses the ability to stop said instance.
    This means that if an infinitely looping event is played (like music), it may in some cases
    play indefinitely until the game is restarted.

    Please engage in The Silly with care.
